# Classroom
This project was developed with using a variety of technologies, including [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

I utilized [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for bundling, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting, and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for UI design in this MVP project.

If you are interested in the back-end code of this project, you can find it in [Classroom_backend](https://github.com/meyssamh/Classroom_backend).

I plan on updating this project soon, so stay tuned for more updates!



### Install

To start the project, ensure that you run `npm install` command in both the `front-end` and `back-end` modules.



### Caution

If you need to obtain the environment variables, please contact me.

I regret to inform you that the mobile version of the project has not yet been designed.

This project was originally a TDD project, but due to changes in the UI design, I have to write new test files.



### Start

To begin the project, start by running both the SQL Server and back-end module. Once you have completed the necessary setup, you can launch the project by executing the command `npm run dev` in the terminal. To obtain a build version, please run the command `npm run build`. The updated build version can be found in the *dist* folder. To run the build version, you can use the `npm run serve` command in your terminal.

The UI file is placed in the `ui-ux` folder. To access it, you can use Figma.
